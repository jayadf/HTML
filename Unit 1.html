<div class="parabox">
<h3 class="textformat">1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business: </h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">
    The purpose of information technology in modern business have important effects on operations regardless of the size of the enterprise. From multinational corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to smaller-scale businesses that have access to only one single computer system. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages. Information technology is vital in order to maintain or further construct any business. In terms of constructing a website or a blog, the use of technology is crucial as it can not only be viewable across the internet but shared via all different types of web accessabilities, such as social media.

<div class="parabox">
 <h3 class="textformat">1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully:</h3>
<br>
 <p class="textformat">In order to complete digital projects successfully, a variety of skills, methods, resources and even personalities must be taken into consideration when under construction. I’ve broken down different examples of each necessity required in order to carry out a good working project.</p>
<br>
    <h3 class="textformat">Resources:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">In order to even consider building a digital project, the first thing on the agenda would be resources such as IT equipment. Without IT equipment, digital projects will never exist as the lack of resources wouldn’t logically require a team into construction of the project itself. Different equipment will be responsible for each role used in order to complete the task in hand, although - will be vital to the official outcome of completion.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="textformat">Skills & Delegation roles:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Depending on whether this is a team or solo activity - the individual must have a range of different skills in order to complete the task singlehandedly. However, when performing a team activity - each individual must be delegated a role based on their comfort, confident or genuine expertise. </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="textformat">Knowledge:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Knowledge comes with experience - so with this requirement, in order to build the most efficient project possible, some experience is necessary in order to carry out the completion of the project in hand. Each requirement does actually tie in with each other, so in terms of knowledge, there will always be a member of that team who will have more knowledge than another. So the use of effective teamwork must be in order.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Time management:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Time management is an important and often overlooked factor of completing any task given. A team may possess a range of different brilliant ideas, a lack of experience or both. If a team faces this obstacle; a great problem solving method would be the ‘Kanban’ method, this will give a team an opportunity to lay out their ideas in a hierarchy of importance, in the process of ‘do, doing, done’, then if time is on their side, go back to the less important ideas and fit them in where necessary.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Organisation skills:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Organisation is majorly important in carrying out any task, especially projects with a specific deadline. Organisation falls into different categories such as:</p>
    
    <h3><ul><li>Organising time</li>
      
        <li>Organising resources</li>
      
        <li>Organising team members</li>
    
        <li>Organising ideas</li></h3></ul>
    
    <p class="textformat">If organisation is executed effectively, the overall task in hand is more likely going to run smoother than if organisation wasn’t taken into consideration. Afterall, the backbone of completing a project with the best of your abilities relies around organisation.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Planning & Preparation:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Planning and preparing is basically a medley of everything already discussed. In terms of creating a project within a team, the way to plan would be to organise and manage the resources you would need in order to prepare for the given project. Prioritising your time and preparing your team in terms of who would be suitable for which role.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Teamwork:</h3>
    <p>When working on a project in a team, a good balance between information technology equipment and the cooperation of personalities are mandatory. If an organisation delegates a team working together on the same project, of which, possess all of the up to date modern day technology and the ability to execute said project; however, suffer from a lack of communication - the project in hand may result as unsuccessful. Therefore, how individuals function as a team is majorly important to have the ability to communicate between one another in order to complete the project.

<br>
<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT:</h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">Keeping track of progression in tasks are important when using information technology, as planning and preparation will guide you into what ideas you or your team may have, prioritising the hierarchy of what needs to be done in terms of important to non-important tasks are essential as you get what needs to be done and also don’t lose track of the great ideas you can go back to if you have time. The Kanban method is very effective for executing this strategy. Kanban is a Japanese term that means ‘Visual Card’, and it works by creating cards in an order of process such as ‘To do, doing and done.’</p>
    <b></b>
    <p class="textformat">You can access an online Kanban via the website Trello - this way, you will always have track of how to carry out your ideas in terms of prioritising your time. I have constructed a Trello board in order to complete my project, the link is as shown below.

    </p></div>
<br>
<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects:</h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">Digital projects can fail due to a variety of things, from self inflicted human errors, uncontrolled failures to security breaches. I am going to elaborate on a list of reasons as to why digital projects could face potential risks of which could hold negative impact.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">System malfunctions:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">When creating online projects, connecting to the internet is crucial in order to research, create and publish your project. With that being said - if during the construction period of your project, the online systems were to malfunction, the whole entire will be delayed and the work you have made could potentially be set back to the quality of the last online connected value. You will be unable to access the internet for research, unavailable access to open the tools and programs required in order to create your project or the inability to save or publish it.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Security breaches:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">In the event of a security breach - the entire project can come to a stand still. Many ways, a project can fall victim of an unethical hack, however, for example purposes, I am going to mention a brute force password attack. When creating a project, you and your team would have administrator rights. Therefore, if your project was to fall victim of a malicious hack, a hacker could potentially steal admin rights and corrupt the whole project.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Lack of knowledge & skills:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">When creating a project independently or in a team, knowledge is a major priority and necessity as individuals may not possess the required skills that are mandatory for the process and completion of the project. If there is a deadline of completion, this will be a major concern as very little work would have been put in to the project itself.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Human errors & Malware:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">Human errors can tie into many things and happens by everybody on a day to day basis. However, human errors in IT is extraordinary, the reason for this is that there is so much to learn in terms of online technology and nobody possesses the expertise of everything computers have to offer. One error could potentially crash the system and the project can fail. This may happen in numerous ways; malware is commonly the brunt of all errors. Individuals can fall victim of clicking on a malicious website link or application with the thoughts of it leading them to genuine and legitimate online resources, where in fact, could lead them to different types of malware that will have many negative effects to not only the project, but the device itself. A way to prevent this is for organisations to provide online training courses and powerpoint presentations explaining the potential threats of malware and any other negative outcomes based upon human error.</p></div>
<br>
<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software:</h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">Depending on the project being created, my options will vary based on the balance of cost, the functionality they have to offer, availability, location and overall familiarity. Macs are very high in cost and offer limitations on available software and general unfamiliarity to me, personally; especially when compared to PCs and Windows OS. PCs, however - offer fulfilment in all of these substantially. The only downsides are that they are very difficult to set up the hardware components and are strictly built to be worked on in the same location and environment. In order words, as opposed to their competitors, Mac, as they can be transported from place to place with ease. Although, it is very important that the software used for creating the project to work - many programs are available on both Mac and Windows OS. Whereas, specific programs, especially those associated with Apple products are only usable on Mac OS.</p>
    <p class="textformat">Most remote storage via cloud are HTML based and can be accessed by a web browser, as well as accessible by smartphones and can be used by teams using numerous OS’. If an individual’s work device uses Mac OS, but their home computer runs with Windows OS, the enabling of cross-platform work would be more beneficial for that user. For the project I am creating, I will be using a Macbook.</p></div>
<br>
<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes:</h3>
    <br>
<p class="textformat">When creating my project, I prioritise my time by creating a Kanban method via a Trello board. It was extremely useful when working with the ideas that I’ve had whilst also combatting the amount of time given to complete this project. The reason I’ve chosen this method was due to the fact I had tasks to complete that must be made in order to meet the criteria and expectations set to complete the project. Prior to that, I’ve also had many ideas to add to my project, some I already knew how to do, some I needed to learn how to do. This was made easier by dragging over all of my most important tasks and dropping them in the section which suggests I have completed and achieved my goals. This gave me time to go back to previous ideas and estimate the time I have left to learn new coding in order to complete these tasks I’ve set for myself.</p>
<p class="textformat">I’ve also used GitHub in order to complete my project, this was very useful to me as the Macbook I have been using could not be taken with me in order to add to my work at home. With this being said, I would use GitHub to update my ideas and plausible strategies to update and upgrade my project, as it is cross-platform, I was able to edit my work, push it into GitHub and when I’m proceeding with using the Macbook I can then pull my latest version of my work, and put it directly into my project itself.</p>
<p class="textformat">Another added bonus about GitHub is that if you seek employment in the web development industry, you can give employers your direct link to your personal GitHub page in order to view sites you have built to show your knowledge and talents - similar to a digital portfolio.
        </p></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects:</h3>
    <br>
<p class="textformat">GDPR stands for “General Data Protection Regulations” and is an EU guideline that came into force on May 25th 2018 regarding data protection
    It defines data as; “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person including identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifiers, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
    GDPR is a new set of rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. It aims to simplify the regulatory environment for business so both citizens and businesses in the European Union can fully benefit from the digital economy.
    GDPR enforces that all digital companies must process personal data in the mind of minimising data, restricting the used information to the bare minimum to stop the movement flow of personal data. This helps reduce the risks impact of leaked or lost data, including collections of unnecessary information such as the usage of email addresses for future marketing purposes.
    Removing personal identifiers, IPs, names, addresses, credentials etc is a common way to hide data, even while collecting data such as date of birth, income and ethnic origin etc. This also makes it non-requiring with GDPR.
    The legislation also helps bring foreign competitors operating within the EU (which, in today's modern digital market, means globally) must also comply to EU GDPR.

<h1 class="textformat">Unit 1 - Outcome 2</h1>
<br>
<br>
<div class="parabox">
        <h3  class="textformat">2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed:</h3>
        <br>
    <p class="textformat">

            The hardware used didn’t have much impact when creating the project, as Visual Studio Code was primarily used as a text editor for my project and functions identically on Mac and Windows OS. Any up to date desktop browser is able to view the website with full functionality. Although, the use of both Windows and Mac OS show errors in displays that only appear on one or the other system.
            The software I used, especially remote access and allowed easy viewing, editing, downloading and uploading of files. And cross-platform testing to be conducted whenever convenient to do so. Using a cross-platform text editor such as Visual Studio Code, that functions identically on both Mac and Windows was fundamental to my work, as I regularly accessed and edited the code, checking for errors on both systems. This also provided the fundamental basis of my compatibility and accessibility testing.
        </p></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parabox">
        <h3  class="textformat">2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate:</h3>
        <br>
    <p class="textformat">When creating my project, the appropriacy of the tools I’ve used were efficient and relative for me in order of progression and completion of my project. Each tool participated in a different role and guided me to prioritising the management of my time in order to target specific tasks. Trello offered a Kanban method, which, ultimately posed as a task calendar - in other words, it helped me organise what I had to do in the time I had available to prioritise which to target. Visual Studio Code was extremely helpful, also, as it offered visual content and display of how the coding is to meet the eye from layout to colour co-ordination. Visual Studio Code was heavily relied on as it was fundamental to the project because in real time it would change colour based on the outcomes of the codes I have put in. It would also highlight errors to notify where I have gone wrong in order for me to fix.
        </p></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parabox">
        <h3  class="textformat">2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project:</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="textformat">The final product works as intended on desktop browsers, but does not function properly on mobile devices, as the images and text do not fit as I wanted to the different aspects of screen layouts. 
Despite using CSS code that relies on the default font settings of the browsers, the text remains small and difficult to read on mobile phone devices. Therefore, a default text size would be a stronger choice for a mobile version of the site.
The browsers code, however, is helpful when viewing from customised browsers - such as those used from a more comfortably formatted home PC.
The site is also built around providing each page a simplistic colour contrasting theme based through background images, using similarly grouped and formatted text with solid negative colours such as shades of black and white, selected to help make them easier to read and not get lost or distracted from the actual text but also fits well into modern design aesthetics. I attempted to keep it simplistic as I believe that when too much visual noise is going on in a website, it is too distracting from the actual content and therefore, overlooked. As a viewer of many websites prior to my own, the attitude of ‘what’s less is more’ is what has initially influenced me due to past experiences. I chose background wallpapers over actual images as every professionally made website I’ve visited offers the same outcomes.
The text I have added into my website has a full opposite contrast to stand out to viewers whilst attempting to keep visually modern and dynamic, this helps the content to become easily readable.</p></div>
<br>
        <div class="parabox">
        <h3  class="textformat">2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project:</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="textformat">In order to improve my website I could identify the browsers in order to make it more compatible for a mobile device, using different methods to polish all rough edges in my project, such as: operating side menus rather than a top navigation bar, as it is primarily standard in apps and mobile versions. Also, in my personal opinion, looks smarter and much more professional.
                I would also use larger buttons for users who use touch screen devices that are usually smaller than your average screen. If given more time for this project with the comfort of the tools and programs I’m familiar with, I would create banners and backgrounds from scratch using Adobe Photoshop to have a unique design and avoid infringement of copyright, therefore, having full control over thematic and colour choices.

                        <br>
                        <p class="textformat">My final outcome is fit for purpose as my goals have met the criteria that have been set. It fulfils a technical understanding of HTML and CSS, utilises JavaScript and visually aesthetically pleasing, professional looking as my primary objective was to create a website that is easy to use and visually appealing.
                                The website uses only available file types and code languages to appear visible on regular browses that are widely used without relying on plugins. The advantage taken from CSS was using a range of font sizes from large - XX-large to use the browsers customisable built in viewing preferences to increase accessibility to the site.

                                        <br>
                                        <p class="textformat">The use of cloud storage enabled remote accessing and authorisation of editing files whenever needed, also, offered the option to use time out of hours to update the project.
                                                Personally, I feel that the use of teamwork has its pros and cons in order to complete the project how you’d like to. The constant recapping on which team member did what would be ongoingly confusing and would also take away the self-accomplishment in finishing the project solo. Also, individuals would have different opinions which can cause disagreements on the finishing project. Claiming responsibility for building a website using different codes is satisfactory - however, other individuals would have the knowledge on something you may be struggling with and could finish that aspect with ease.
                                                I relied heavily on my past experiences with Adobe Photoshop in order to visually scope out how I would like my website to look with the professionalism and suitability of the font I have chosen against a background that wasn’t too busy to neglect the content within.
                                                On the other hand, if the project was to build a larger website, structured teamwork may have been useful.

                                                        <p class="textformat">The use of a framework editor was helpful as it provided the opportunity to not manually write the code out for myself. This was very efficient as it sped up the process, giving me extra time to be able to focus on other things needed to complete my project. Although, this can cause limitations in creativity, causing a generic looking final product that doesn’t quite differ than other websites, lacking certain features that require specific codes to be written.
                                                                For larger projects, the use of teamwork is ideal and specialisation within the team can allow different individuals to partake in different roles based on their knowledge. This can be very efficient and offer very high quality code being written using a framework as opposed to code.

I feel like I have met the criteria of delivering a professional feel to the website layout using very simplistic, yet dynamic design, which has had the feedback of professional standards to my project.
                                                                        However, occasionally - I would neglect my trello board and just jump from multiple ideas I’ve spontaneously come up with to add to my Trello board at a later time. This initially was a misuse of the kanban method and therefore, leaving me to backtrack my own ideas of what I’ve completed.
                                                                        If working in a team, this would have had a negative impact as if we were referring to the Trello board, finished results would not have been identifiable.
                                                                        Also, the constant movement of different working environments, adopting and adapting to different work stations while attempting to continue working often interrupted thoughts and workflows, resulting in forgetting to push to GitHub, this caused me to repeat work I have already done, on one occasion.
                                                                        </p></div>
                                                    </p></div>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <div class="parabox">
                                                    <h3  class="textformat">3.4 - Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions:</h3>
                                                    <br>
                                                    <p class="textformat">I would test the digital solutions of my project by using different platforms in order to see where is compatible, if any complications arise when using computers and mobile devices via Chrome, Firefox and Windows. Adjusting ratios and rescaling of text boxes used, using individual links from each page after editing to ensure good functionality.
                                                            I have also used a contained HTML file to test isolated codes before combining it into the webpage, separating JavaScript, HTML and CSS codes into their correct files. This eliminated syntax errors from moving the CSS code, when seperated. This pointed me in the right direction of fixing uncooperative code, to a code in good working order.</p></div>
