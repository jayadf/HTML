<h3 class="textformat">1.1) Describing the purpose of IT in modern business: </h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">
    The purpose of information technology in modern business have important effects on operations regardless of the size of the enterprise. From multinational corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to smaller-scale businesses that have access to only one single computer system. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages. Information technology is vital in order to maintain or further construct any business. In terms of constructing a website or a blog, the use of technology is crucial as it can not only be viewable across the internet but shared via all different types of web accessabilities, such as social media.

 <h3 class="textformat">1.2) Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully:</h3>
<br>
 <p class="textformat">In order to complete digital projects successfully, a variety of skills, methods, resources and even personalities must be taken into consideration when under construction. I’ve broken down different examples of each necessity required in order to carry out a good working project.</p>
<br>
    <h3 class="textformat">Resources:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">In order to even consider building a digital project, the first thing on the agenda would be resources such as IT equipment. Without IT equipment, digital projects will never exist as the lack of resources wouldn’t logically require a team into construction of the project itself. Different equipment will be responsible for each role used in order to complete the task in hand, although - will be vital to the official outcome of completion.</p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="textformat">Skills & Delegation roles:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Depending on whether this is a team or solo activity - the individual must have a range of different skills in order to complete the task singlehandedly. However, when performing a team activity - each individual must be delegated a role based on their comfort, confident or genuine expertise. </p>
    <br>
    <h3 class="textformat">Knowledge:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Knowledge comes with experience - so with this requirement, in order to build the most efficient project possible, some experience is necessary in order to carry out the completion of the project in hand. Each requirement does actually tie in with each other, so in terms of knowledge, there will always be a member of that team who will have more knowledge than another. So the use of effective teamwork must be in order.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Time management:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Time management is an important and often overlooked factor of completing any task given. A team may possess a range of different brilliant ideas, a lack of experience or both. If a team faces this obstacle; a great problem solving method would be the ‘Kanban’ method, this will give a team an opportunity to lay out their ideas in a hierarchy of importance, in the process of ‘do, doing, done’, then if time is on their side, go back to the less important ideas and fit them in where necessary.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Organisation skills:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Organisation is majorly important in carrying out any task, especially projects with a specific deadline. Organisation falls into different categories such as:</p>
    
    <h3><ul><li>Organising time</li>
      
        <li>Organising resources</li>
      
        <li>Organising team members</li>
    
        <li>Organising ideas</li></h3></ul>
    
    <p class="textformat">If organisation is executed effectively, the overall task in hand is more likely going to run smoother than if organisation wasn’t taken into consideration. Afterall, the backbone of completing a project with the best of your abilities relies around organisation.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Planning & Preparation:</h3>
    
    <p class="textformat">Planning and preparing is basically a medley of everything already discussed. In terms of creating a project within a team, the way to plan would be to organise and manage the resources you would need in order to prepare for the given project. Prioritising your time and preparing your team in terms of who would be suitable for which role.</p>
    <br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Teamwork:</h3>
    <p>When working on a project in a team, a good balance between information technology equipment and the cooperation of personalities are mandatory. If an organisation delegates a team working together on the same project, of which, possess all of the up to date modern day technology and the ability to execute said project; however, suffer from a lack of communication - the project in hand may result as unsuccessful. Therefore, how individuals function as a team is majorly important to have the ability to communicate between one another in order to complete the project.

<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.3) Plan and carry out tasks using IT:</h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">Keeping track of progression in tasks are important when using information technology, as planning and preparation will guide you into what ideas you or your team may have, prioritising the hierarchy of what needs to be done in terms of important to non-important tasks are essential as you get what needs to be done and also don’t lose track of the great ideas you can go back to if you have time. The Kanban method is very effective for executing this strategy. Kanban is a Japanese term that means ‘Visual Card’, and it works by creating cards in an order of process such as ‘To do, doing and done.’</p>
    <b></b>
    <p class="textformat">You can access an online Kanban via the website Trello - this way, you will always have track of how to carry out your ideas in terms of prioritising your time. I have constructed a Trello board in order to complete my project, the link is as shown below.

<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.4) Describe the risks that might impact digital projects:</h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">Digital projects can fail due to a variety of things, from self inflicted human errors, uncontrolled failures to security breaches. I am going to elaborate on a list of reasons as to why digital projects could face potential risks of which could hold negative impact.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">System malfunctions:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">When creating online projects, connecting to the internet is crucial in order to research, create and publish your project. With that being said - if during the construction period of your project, the online systems were to malfunction, the whole entire will be delayed and the work you have made could potentially be set back to the quality of the last online connected value. You will be unable to access the internet for research, unavailable access to open the tools and programs required in order to create your project or the inability to save or publish it.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Security breaches:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">In the event of a security breach - the entire project can come to a stand still. Many ways, a project can fall victim of an unethical hack, however, for example purposes, I am going to mention a brute force password attack. When creating a project, you and your team would have administrator rights. Therefore, if your project was to fall victim of a malicious hack, a hacker could potentially steal admin rights and corrupt the whole project.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Lack of knowledge & skills:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">When creating a project independently or in a team, knowledge is a major priority and necessity as individuals may not possess the required skills that are mandatory for the process and completion of the project. If there is a deadline of completion, this will be a major concern as very little work would have been put in to the project itself.</p>
<br>
    <h3  class="textformat">Human errors & Malware:</h3>

    <p class="textformat">Human errors can tie into many things and happens by everybody on a day to day basis. However, human errors in IT is extraordinary, the reason for this is that there is so much to learn in terms of online technology and nobody possesses the expertise of everything computers have to offer. One error could potentially crash the system and the project can fail. This may happen in numerous ways; malware is commonly the brunt of all errors. Individuals can fall victim of clicking on a malicious website link or application with the thoughts of it leading them to genuine and legitimate online resources, where in fact, could lead them to different types of malware that will have many negative effects to not only the project, but the device itself. A way to prevent this is for organisations to provide online training courses and powerpoint presentations explaining the potential threats of malware and any other negative outcomes based upon human error.</p></div>
<br>
<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.5) Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software:</h3>
<br>
    <p class="textformat">Depending on the project being created, my options will vary based on the balance of cost, the functionality they have to offer, availability, location and overall familiarity. Macs are very high in cost and offer limitations on available software and general unfamiliarity to me, personally; especially when compared to PCs and Windows OS. PCs, however - offer fulfilment in all of these substantially. The only downsides are that they are very difficult to set up the hardware components and are strictly built to be worked on in the same location and environment. In order words, as opposed to their competitors, Mac, as they can be transported from place to place with ease. Although, it is very important that the software used for creating the project to work - many programs are available on both Mac and Windows OS. Whereas, specific programs, especially those associated with Apple products are only usable on Mac OS.</p>
    <p class="textformat">Most remote storage via cloud are HTML based and can be accessed by a web browser, as well as accessible by smartphones and can be used by teams using numerous OS’. If an individual’s work device uses Mac OS, but their home computer runs with Windows OS, the enabling of cross-platform work would be more beneficial for that user. For the project I am creating, I will be using a Macbook.</p></div>
<br>
<div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.6) Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes:</h3>
    <br>
<p class="textformat">When creating my project, I prioritise my time by creating a Kanban method via a Trello board. It was extremely useful when working with the ideas that I’ve had whilst also combatting the amount of time given to complete this project. The reason I’ve chosen this method was due to the fact I had tasks to complete that must be made in order to meet the criteria and expectations set to complete the project. Prior to that, I’ve also had many ideas to add to my project, some I already knew how to do, some I needed to learn how to do. This was made easier by dragging over all of my most important tasks and dropping them in the section which suggests I have completed and achieved my goals. This gave me time to go back to previous ideas and estimate the time I have left to learn new coding in order to complete these tasks I’ve set for myself.</p>
<p class="textformat">I’ve also used GitHub in order to complete my project, this was very useful to me as the Macbook I have been using could not be taken with me in order to add to my work at home. With this being said, I would use GitHub to update my ideas and plausible strategies to update and upgrade my project, as it is cross-platform, I was able to edit my work, push it into GitHub and when I’m proceeding with using the Macbook I can then pull my latest version of my work, and put it directly into my project itself.</p>
<p class="textformat">Another added bonus about GitHub is that if you seek employment in the web development industry, you can give employers your direct link to your personal GitHub page in order to view sites you have built to show your knowledge and talents - similar to a digital portfolio.
        </p></div>
        <br>
        <div class="parabox">
    <h3  class="textformat">1.7) Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects:</h3>
    <br>
<p class="textformat">GDPR stands for “General Data Protection Regulations” and is an EU guideline that came into force on May 25th 2018 regarding data protection
    It defines data as; “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person including identifiers such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifiers, or, for example, factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person”.
    GDPR is a new set of rules designed to give EU citizens more control over their personal data. It aims to simplify the regulatory environment for business so both citizens and businesses in the European Union can fully benefit from the digital economy.
    GDPR enforces that all digital companies must process personal data in the mind of minimising data, restricting the used information to the bare minimum to stop the movement flow of personal data. This helps reduce the risks impact of leaked or lost data, including collections of unnecessary information such as the usage of email addresses for future marketing purposes.
    Removing personal identifiers, IPs, names, addresses, credentials etc is a common way to hide data, even while collecting data such as date of birth, income and ethnic origin etc. This also makes it non-requiring with GDPR.
    The legislation also helps bring foreign competitors operating within the EU (which, in today's modern digital market, means globally) must also comply to EU GDPR.
