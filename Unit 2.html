<h3 class="textformat">1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page:</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="textformat">The landing page is set out to be minimalistic, professional looking and sleek - it is a simple opposite contrasting background compared to the rest of the site with a parallax scrolling system attached in order to keep the main attraction in a centered position to the screen. There are hyperlinks connected to each page for Unit 1 and Unit 2 with each outcome attached. However, Unit 1 and Unit 2 pages are somewhat identical regarding the content written. In regards of contrast to the home page, the other pages I have created are of the reversed negative shades. I believe this breaks away from the pages being completely identical throughout, but keeps it sleek, minimalistic and professional. My aim was to make my content easily readable, a high reduction of visible background noise which is easier to digest by the reader. Each page has a ‘Return to top’ feature placed at the bottom, when clicked, returns the reader to the top of the screen and therefore can proceed onto the next page much easier. This gave the finishing product predictable and clear while promoting and maintaining a professional, minimalistic and modern style approach to today’s websites.

    <h3 class="textformat">1.5 - Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites:</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="textformat">Copyrighting is a form of protection provided to the creators of original works of authorship, including literary, dramatic, musical, artistic, and certain other intellectual works. In terms of copyrighting in websites, individuals can have the rights of ownership of original ideas from content, graphical design, visual elements and many more, when copyrighted at the time of development. 
                Putting a copyright notice on the bottom of a site states that the material displayed is not to be used without permission of the owner and can therefore, be a legal conflict on the matter.
                Generally, the creator owns the rights to the work, except in the case of a “work for hire” arrangement, such as an employer or an employee relationship. Freelancers and business owners can be hired to create specific work - thus, granting them rights of ownership and therefore retain all rights of that specific piece of work. Unless, those individuals have a ‘work for hire’ agreement with the client - which then grants the client ownership of work. In order to avoid the hassle of copyrighting related arguments, these details should be negotiated in the contract, leaving no question on ownership rights.

    <h3 class="textformat">1.6 - Describe access issues that need taking into account:</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="textformat">Ease of access is a primary feature I have taken into consideration for individuals who have visual impairments, this is the main reason as to why I have chosen to go with a high contrasting background with a minimalistic and simplistic design. This grants all viewers the ability to access the site without the aid of additional assistance. Also, users who may suffer from attention issues possess the ability to read through the content on my website due to the simplistic modern-day styling of a popular contrast of black and white shading, reducing the amount of background noise, targeted specifically, for those individuals, rendering the website itself, tailored for all users. Ease of access is now also built into some OS, starting with Windows 7 - meaning your computer itself will communicate to a webpage that it requires ease of access view settings (enlarged text, for example, or text-to-speech.
            Ease of access is also extremely important as it can also take the form of learning difficulties - presenting information in long, “text-wall” formats can be daunting, especially to people with high-functioning learning difficulties or behavioural traits such as mild ADHD, or OCD.
            It is important to take these into consideration in order to tackle tailoring websites for users of all types: labelling or shortening links into clear, readable text as opposed to a full URL, the use of headings and subheadings to break down content to pose an easily readable chunks of text.

    <h3 class="textformat">1.7 - Describe which are appropriate file types for websites:</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="textformat">There are various file types appropriate used for different data expressions on websites using HTML - some of these require additional programs or plug-ins to open, such as Flash.
            Others, such as JPG, AVI and GIF can be opened by numerous browsers without additional support.
            Audio types such as WAV, MP3 and MP4 (video related format) and other older formats, which are still used across the web but considered outdated, rendering them unpopular to today’s standards.
            PDF files are often used in websites, although, require plug-ins in order to open them in a specialist file format such as Adobe Reader, which is a free to use for both desktop and mobile devices, along with many more.
            These formats are widely used in today’s IT society, especially for large text documents.
