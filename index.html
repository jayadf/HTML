 <h1>My blog</h1>
 <p>My name is Jordan Fannon and I am currently taking a web development course with CodeNation. Although, my background doesn’t revolve around IT aspects or any form of computer background whatsoever. </p>   

 <h2>Unit 1</h2>

<h3>1.1) Describing the purpose of IT in modern business: </h3>
    <p>
    The purpose of information technology in modern business have important effects on operations regardless of the size of the enterprise. From multinational corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to smaller-scale businesses that have access to only one single computer system. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages. Information technology is vital in order to maintain or further construct any business. In terms of constructing a website or a blog, the use of technology is crucial as it can not only be viewable across the internet but shared via all different types of web accessabilities, such as social media.

 <h4>1.2) Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully:</h4>

 <p>In order to complete digital projects successfully, a variety of skills, methods, resources and even personalities must be taken into consideration when under construction. I’ve broken down different examples of each necessity required in order to carry out a good working project.</p>

    <h5>Resources:</h5>
    
    <p>In order to even consider building a digital project, the first thing on the agenda would be resources such as IT equipment. Without IT equipment, digital projects will never exist as the lack of resources wouldn’t logically require a team into construction of the project itself. Different equipment will be responsible for each role used in order to complete the task in hand, although - will be vital to the official outcome of completion.</p>
    
    <h6>Skills & Delegation roles:</h6>
    
    <p>Depending on whether this is a team or solo activity - the individual must have a range of different skills in order to complete the task singlehandedly. However, when performing a team activity - each individual must be delegated a role based on their comfort, confident or genuine expertise. </p>
    
    <h7>Knowledge:</h7>
    
    <p>Knowledge comes with experience - so with this requirement, in order to build the most efficient project possible, some experience is necessary in order to carry out the completion of the project in hand. Each requirement does actually tie in with each other, so in terms of knowledge, there will always be a member of that team who will have more knowledge than another. So the use of effective teamwork must be in order.</p>
    
    <h8>Time management:</h8>
    
    <p>Time management is an important and often overlooked factor of completing any task given. A team may possess a range of different brilliant ideas, a lack of experience or both. If a team faces this obstacle; a great problem solving method would be the ‘Kanban’ method, this will give a team an opportunity to lay out their ideas in a hierarchy of importance, in the process of ‘do, doing, done’, then if time is on their side, go back to the less important ideas and fit them in where necessary.</p>
    
    <h9>Organisation skills:</h9>
    
    <p>Organisation is majorly important in carrying out any task, especially projects with a specific deadline. Organisation falls into different categories such as:</p>
    
    <h10>Organising time
        Organising resources
        Organising team members
        Organising ideas</h10>
    
    <p>If organisation is executed effectively, the overall task in hand is more likely going to run smoother than if organisation wasn’t taken into consideration. Afterall, the backbone of completing a project with the best of your abilities relies around organisation.</p>
    
    <h11>Planning & Preparation:</h11>
    
    <p>Planning and preparing is basically a medley of everything already discussed. In terms of creating a project within a team, the way to plan would be to organise and manage the resources you would need in order to prepare for the given project. Prioritising your time and preparing your team in terms of who would be suitable for which role.</p>
    
    <h12>Teamwork:</h12>
    
    <p>When working on a project in a team, a good balance between information technology equipment and the cooperation of personalities are mandatory. If an organisation delegates a team working together on the same project, of which, possess all of the up to date modern day technology and the ability to execute said project; however, suffer from a lack of communication - the project in hand may result as unsuccessful. Therefore, how individuals function as a team is majorly important to have the ability to communicate between one another in order to complete the project.
