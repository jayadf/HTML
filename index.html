     <p>        <h1 class="textformatindex">About Me</h1>
 <br>
 <h3 class="textformatindex">My name is Jordan Fannon (Jay) and I am currently a student in the web development course provided by CodeNation. Although my background doesnâ€™t revolve around IT aspects or any form of computer background whatsoever. I have grown a strong passion for both subjects I have participated in during my time here at CodeNation. In my spare time I have a strong passion for training in bodybuilding and health and fitness in general.
        I also socialise with my friends, creating memories through spontaneous activities - I have come from a military inspired background which has taught me respect, discipline and a good mindset which, I believe, can be used flexibly throughout multiple aspects of life.
        I have a keen interest in activities I have partaken in, such as modelling, acting and sporting activities such as football, running and used to do martial arts sporting activities also.
